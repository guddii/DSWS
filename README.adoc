This repository presents an innovative approach to developing data-sovereign Web services using the Solid protocol.
This concept involves capturing personal data and data held in trust and making it available to other services.
To demonstrate this idea, 12 services have been created to represent government agencies or other organizations that act as trustees for citizens.
Personal data management can be accomplished through a citizen service that stores personal data and references to the data held in trust.

The research was conducted as part of https://modulux.htwk-leipzig.de/modulux/modul/6290[C149.2] and aims to provide a simplified example of an e-governance scenario.
For a detailed explanation of the approach, including its benefits and drawbacks, please visit: {url}/paper/README.html

== Installation

An .env file is required to provide the necessary environment variables at runtime.
You can find the available environment variables in xref:.env.example[] or copy the entire file:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
----

You need to create https://start.inrupt.com/[Inrupt profiles] and register corresponding https://login.inrupt.com/registration.html[Inrupt application] for each service.
Add the WebID, Client ID, and Client secret to the process as environment variables.

This is a https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager[Node.js] based project, please use the package manager https://pnpm.io/installation[pnpm] to install this project.

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install
----

== Usage

If you want to run this project in development mode, enter the following command in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm run dev
----

If the servers have booted successfully, you can select one of the local servers listed in the table below to access the services.
If you do not want to manually start the servers, you can use one of the available public examples.
In both cases, it is recommended to begin with the 'citizen' service and then proceed to any other desired services.
